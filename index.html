    <h1>Chapter 1 : Multiple Timelines, Books & People, But One Storyline</h1>
    <p>All the books compiled in the Bible are from different time periods written by different authors but how come there are references interconnected all over the Bible? The answer stays simple, itâ€™s through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, who worked through these authors.</p>

    <h1>Chapter 2 : From A Humble Jewish Girl to The Mother of Christ and Church</h1>
    <p>The first person who played an important role in the early church is Mother Mary. To be frank, whom do you think spent the most time with Jesus? Was it the Disciples, St. Joseph, or the Pharisees? No, it was Mother Mary who was at the birth, death, resurrection and descent of the Holy Spirit.</p>
